# Software and Hardware Architecture

This repository contains the course materials I found on [Software and Hardware Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/embedded-software-hardware/home/welcome).

## Course Description

This course covers the fundamentals of embedded software development, from the basics of C programming.Students will learn how to write efficient and reliable code for embedded systems, as well as how to debug and test their code.

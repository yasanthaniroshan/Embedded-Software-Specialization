# Memory Alignment
- Memory storage interacting with the CPU
    - Code Memory
    - Data Memory
    - Registers (Peripherals)

- Memory interfaces to CPU through Busses

- Load-Store architecture requires operations to occur in CPU
    - Data gets loaded into CPU
    - Data is operated on
    - Data is stored back

## Data Aligned
- CPU efficient
- Memory inefficient

## Data Packed
- CPU inefficient
- Memory efficient
